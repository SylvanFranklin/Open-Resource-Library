# Introduction

Welcome to the VERSO Open Resource Library.

:::warning
This site is currently being rewritten.
:::

This library exists as a collection of documents to support the open-source community at UVM.
The library mainly serves to be a jumping-off point for further knowledge about open-source.

If you see any information that needs changing, or just want to contribute to our open documentation you can do so on the ORL's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/VERSO-UVM/Open-Resource-Library).

At the bottom of many pages is a "References" section, listing other resources used to compile the information.
These references can also be used as additional resources to learn more about the contents of the page.

## Additional Resources

- [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/). Arch Linux's official wiki, contains useful information applicable to many Linux distributions.

# Swift
[https://www.swift.org/](https://www.swift.org/)

Swift is a versatile programming language designed by Apple Inc. and the open-source community. Launched in June 2014, Swift is a high-level, compiled language that leverages LLVM technology to produce efficient machine code. It has been integrated into Apple's development ecosystem since Xcode version 6, released in the same year.

One of Swift's primary objectives is to combine the best aspects of Objective-C with enhanced safety features. It supports dynamic dispatch, late binding, and extensible programming while minimizing common errors like null pointer dereferencing. Swift also introduces modern programming paradigms such as protocol-oriented programming, which emphasizes protocol extensibility for types, structs, and classes.

Since its open-source debut in 2015, Swift has evolved significantly. Version 5.10, released in March 2024, showcases advancements in concurrency and data isolation, paving the way for Swift 6. The language's continuous development underscores its commitment to providing developers with powerful tools for building robust and scalable software solutions.

## Educational Resources
[Develop in Swift](https://education.apple.com/learning-center/T021340A?backTo=%2Flearning-center%2FT021339A-en_US%3FbackTo%3D%2Flearning-center)_
Develop in Swift is a comprehensive coding offering from Apple for ages 14 and up. The curriculum prepares students for college or a career in app development using the Swift programming language. It’s complemented with free online professional learning for educators, and is designed for Mac which supports all major programming languages, making it the ideal device for teaching and learning code. Develop in Swift curriculum is intended for high school and higher education students to explore designing and building a fully functioning app of their own. As they develop new skills, students will master key coding concepts and can even earn AP credit or an industry‑recognized certification for knowledge of Swift and Xcode.

## Research Kit

Apple ResearchKit is a software framework developed by Apple Inc. that allows researchers and developers to create powerful and user-friendly mobile applications for medical and health research. Launched in 2015, ResearchKit leverages the capabilities of Apple devices such as iPhones and Apple Watches to collect data from participants for various medical studies and clinical trials.

One of the key features of Apple ResearchKit is its ability to facilitate the gathering of real-time, objective data through sensors and interactive tasks on Apple devices. This includes collecting information such as heart rate, physical activity levels, cognitive functions, and more, all while maintaining user privacy and data security.

ResearchKit also provides tools for researchers to design customizable surveys, consent forms, and data collection modules within their apps. Additionally, it includes integration with HealthKit, Apple's health data platform, allowing researchers to access a wide range of health-related data from participants who opt-in to share their data for research purposes.

## Care Kit

Apple CareKit is a software framework developed by Apple Inc. that aims to empower individuals to take a more active role in managing their own health and wellness. Launched in 2016, CareKit is designed to complement Apple's HealthKit and ResearchKit frameworks, providing a comprehensive platform for healthcare-related apps on iOS devices.

One of the primary goals of Apple CareKit is to enable developers to create user-friendly apps that help individuals track and manage their medical conditions, symptoms, medications, and overall health goals. These apps can leverage the sensors and capabilities of Apple devices, such as the iPhone and Apple Watch, to collect relevant health data and provide personalized insights and recommendations.

## Investigator Support Program

Apple'sInvestigator Support Program aims to equip researchers with Apple devices to enhance their research studies, mirroring the success seen by integrating Apple Watch into research and healthcare programs. Interested parties can start by creating a study protocol and an iOS study app plan, selecting relevant Apple Watch data types, and leveraging frameworks like ResearchKit and CareKit for health research app development.

To apply for the Investigator Support Program, applicants must complete and submit an application form to research_proposals@apple.com. Apple reviews applications in three cycles annually, with deadlines on January 5, April 5, and September 5, typically rendering decisions 6-8 weeks post-deadline. Proposal evaluations consider factors like study design, product availability, Apple product and framework utilization, operational feasibility, and potential impact on users, patients, or the scientific community. It's important to note that while the program provides Apple device support, it does not offer study sponsorship, funding, or app development assistance

## Spatial Computing News
Spatial computing is a technology that integrates virtual elements into the real world. While Apple isn't the pioneer in this field, it has invested in the idea with its AR/VR headset, the Apple Vision Pro. Spatial computing, demonstrated through devices like the Apple Vision Pro, Microsoft HoloLens, Meta Quest Pro, and Magic Leap, overlays virtual objects onto real-world scenes, creating a three-dimensional experience.

Mastering version control systems like Git to manage code repositories efficiently, especially using GitHub and Gitlab

# Git Documentation for College Open Source Program

## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that enables collaborative software development. It tracks changes in files, allowing multiple developers to work on projects simultaneously. It records project history and facilitates efficient collaboration by merging changes.

### Origins

Developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to manage the Linux kernel development, Git was created to address limitations in existing version control systems.

## Key Features

- **Distributed Development:** Git allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously.
- **Branching and Merging:** Enables creating separate lines of development and merging changes.
- **History Tracking:** Records changes, making it easy to review project history.
- **Fast and Efficient:** Lightweight and performs operations quickly.
- **Open Source:** Free and accessible for various platforms.

## Installation and Setup

### Installing Git on Different Platforms

#### Windows

- Download the installer from [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).
- Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.

#### macOS

- Install Git using Homebrew:

- Install Git using Homebrew:
brew install git

#### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

- Use apt to install Git:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git

### Basic Configuration

After installation, configure Git by setting your username and email:
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

## Creating a Git Repository

### Initializing a Local Repository

To start version controlling a project, initialize a local Git repository:
git init

### Cloning an Existing Repository

To create a copy of an existing repository, use the `git clone` command:
git clone <repository URL>

## Basic Git Commands

- **`git add`**: Add changes to the staging area.
- **`git commit`**: Record changes to the repository.
- **`git status`**: Show the status of changes in the working directory.
- **`git log`**: Display the commit history.

## Branching and Merging

### Creating and Switching Branches

- **Create a new branch**:
git branch <branch-name>

- **Switch to a branch**:
git checkout <branch-name>

### Merging Branches

- **Merge changes from one branch to another**:
git merge <branch-name>
